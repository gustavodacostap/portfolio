I’ve been applying my knowledge to real-world projects using technologies such as React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, Node.js, C#, and ASP.NET Core. I've developed full stack applications, RESTful APIs, and Excel-based automations, as well as integrations with databases and internal systems. My goal is to work in the tech industry, in Brazil or abroad, and I’m building this path with dedication, continuous learning, and a focus on delivering valuable solutions to real problems.",

Later, the project evolved into a modern Single Page Application (SPA) using RESTful API, AJAX, and modular JavaScript (ES Modules), allowing dynamic updates without page reloads. This project was created to improve my full stack ASP.NET Core skills. It uses SQLite as a local database, so there’s no live version available, but you can see how the application works through the images below.",

The application features a modern, responsive, and accessible frontend that consumes exchange rate data from a custom-built backend API, developed separately. The backend is hosted for free on Render, which may cause a slight delay on the first request due to the platform’s automatic sleep mode when the API is inactive.",

The application reads a standardized Excel spreadsheet, processes the data, and automatically updates the holiday-related tables in the company’s database. The system was built as a reusable utility class integrated into the main system, and includes features for generating logs and Excel reports to review the imported data. The code is modularized and well-documented to facilitate future maintenance and adaptations.",

It features an intuitive interface, visual feedback via toast notifications, and real-time interactions, such as automatically generating a new password when adjusting the length. This was my first project using React + TypeScript and it helped me solidify key concepts like state management, side effects, and working with references using hooks.",
